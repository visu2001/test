As a kid I always remember riding in the tractor with my dad, hauling grain to the elevator. Now I have worked at the elevator during harvest and have seen the other side....</p>

  		<h2>What are the 3 farm laws, and why are farmers protesting?</h2>
  		<br><h3>Farmers in Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against three farm reform bills — The Farmers’ Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Bill, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill — passed by the Parliament in the recently concluded Monsoon session. Last week, Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, an MP of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), one of the BJP’s oldest allies, resigned from the Narendra Modi Cabinet, in protest against the bills.While farmers are protesting against all three bills, their objections are mostly against the provisions of the first. And while there is no uniform demand among the protesters or a unified leadership, it emerges that their concerns are mainly about sections relating to “trade area”, “trader”, “dispute resolution” and “market fee” in the first bill.As many as 31 farmers’ organisations, which have different ideologies and leanings, are to fight collectively against these Bills, and the first agenda on their common programme is the ‘Punjab Bandh Call’, slated for Friday (September 25).“The economic investment of one rupee in NMM and HPC families,” the report said.</h3></div></div>

<div>
  		<h2>Weather advisories drive farmers’ income up to 50%</h2>
  		<br><h3>A survey by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has shown that timely delivery of weather advisories to farmers had a significant impact on their income.The survey was done to gauge the economic impact of India’s investments on the National Monsoon Mission (NMM) and High Performance Computing Facilities (HPC). It showed that farmers taking precautionary actions based on agrometeorology advisories from the government reported an increase in income of up to 50 per cent.The survey was based on interviews with 3,965 farmers across 121 districts of 11 states across India. It examined the impact of investments on the NMM under which, an extensive agrometeorology advisory programme was taken up.The India Meteorological Department and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research send district-level agrometeorological advisories to over 22 million farmers through a network of 130 agro-met field units.These advisories also recommend suitable changes or advice for farm operations like management of sowing, changing crop variety, spraying pesticides for disease control and managing irrigation.Climate change-induced disasters are wreaking havoc on Indian farmers.</h3></div></div>

  		<h2>Punjab rejects Centre’s new agri laws, passes 3 bills of its own</h2>
  		<br><h3>The Punjab government passed three bills October 20, 2020, to counter the Narendra Modi government’s three agriculture related laws, becoming the first state in the country to do so. The Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce Promotion & Facilitation (Punjab Amendment) Bill 2020, Farmers Agreement on Price Assurance & Farm Services (Punjab Amendment) Bill 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Special Provision & Punjab Amendment) Bill were passed unanimously in the special session, after the assembly adopted a resolution to reject the Centre’s legislations in their current form.Following the session, assembly members met Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore to urge upon him to accord his assent to the bills.The three bills essentially provide that no sale or purchase of wheat and paddy — Punjab’s two major crops — will take place below the minimum support price (MSP).The three bills essentially provide that no sale or purchase of wheat and paddy — Punjab’s two major crops — will take place below the minimum support price (MSP).“Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce Promotion & Facilitation (Punjab Amendment) Bill 2020 provides that no sale / purchase of wheat or paddy shall be valid unless price paid for it is equal to or greater than MSP.</h3></div></div>
